My attempts at #tidytuesday

TidyTuesday is a weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem. This project was borne out of the 'R4DS Online Learning Community' and the 'R for Data Science' textbook, 
an emphasis was placed on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, and other tools in the tidyverse ecosystem.

This repository contains the R code used to produce visualizations. My early attempts at TidyTuesday may be modeled off of other people's code. If that is the case, they will be credited within each folder.
