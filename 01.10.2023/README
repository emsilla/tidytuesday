# Notes about Datassets 

Two main datasets: checklist (includes bird counts) and site descriptions

Four data levels 
1. Site level (fixed location) 
2. Season level (within one site, how does it change across seasons)
3. Checklist level (variables across a single checklist, like a date) 
4. Observation level (individual species in checklist)

# Notes about Cleaning 

- To merge datasets, use LOC_ID (location) and PROJ_PERIOD_ID (year) 
- If looking at bird observations, need to filder to only use VALID = 1 (could look at all observations to look at changes in accuracy over time, however)
